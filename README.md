## Introduction

**THIS GAME IS VIEW ONLY**
This was my first taste to programming and was built in Visual Studio, **NOT** Visual Studio Code. I transfered most of my code over to VSC to be able to push up code to GitHub while I transfer over files from one computer to the next. Some files may be missing and wont run properly in your personal computer. Feel free to browse assets folder and see the source code that makes the game run.

## How To Play

Use keyboard **Arrow keys** to move your player _(Astro the bluenose pup)_ up, down, right & left.
when lives run out, the games over! You would have to restart game manually in unity.

Since game isn't cloneable, you can see a game teaser video I made a while back that displays the gameplay in motion.
_Please excuse the insane amount of typos in the YouTube video._

## Tech Stack

- C#
- Unity Game Engine

## Next Steps

**THIS GAME IS STILL A _WORK-IN-PROGRESS_**
Im consistantly looking to improve what I started here. I'd like to add a:

- Menu scene, with:
  - Music on/off section
  - Player character selection _(choice of color doggy)_.
- Would like to also add some background music and sound effects to make the gameplay more interactive.
- Ultimately I'd like to add levels with different intensities, music/sound effects and background.
